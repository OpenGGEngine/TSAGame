//QUEEN DISCUSSION

[
{name;queenGreeting}
I've heard the buzz around here that you'd be coming, Simon!
We heartily welcome you to our village.
{optionCount;1}
{option0;queenGreeting2;Thank you, but why does everyone know me around here?}

[
{name;queenGreeting2}
Well I think you know the answer to that!
You're the hero! The one who defeated Emak those long years ago!
Wait, but then why are you here?
{next;queenEmakDiscussion}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion}
Oh no, does that mean what I think it does?
Did Emak complete his ultimate weapon?
{optionCount;1}
{option0;queenEmakDiscussion2;Unfortunately yes. Wait, where exactly am I?}

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion2}
This is my village, a small outpost of bees forced out of our
city many years ago, back when Emak roamed this realm.

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion3}
After you banished him from here, we thought we'd finally be
able to live in peace, and for the most part we have, but things
have been strange around here for a while.
