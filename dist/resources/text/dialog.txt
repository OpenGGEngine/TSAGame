[
{name;introduction}
Oh, you're finally awake!
You've been here for hours, I was about to go back to the village!
I just came out here to get some pollen and I saw you and ...

]

[
{name;introduction3}
Wait, are you..
are..
are you Simon? What are you doing here?
{next;introduction4}
]

[
{name;introduction4}
I gotta tell the Queen Bee about this!
Head down this path, it'll lead you to our village!
{next;introduction5}
]

[
{name;introduction5}
Wait, I forgot about that THING in the way!
You're Simon, right? Can you fight it?

[
{name;introduction6}
Here's some honey we made recently in case you're hurt.
{next;introduction7}
{item;honey;5}

[
{name;introduction7}
And this extra spear I have for occasions like this!
I'd use it, but I don't like fighting.
{setNext;afterFight}
{item;stingerSpear;1}
]

[
{name;afterFight}
I'll see you in the town!
Man, I really don't like fighting...
]

[
{name;discussTown}
We gotta go talk to the Queen about this!
She's in that second building there, the left one.
She'll fill you in on what's been going on.

//QUEEN DISCUSSION

[
{name;queenGreeting}
I've heard the buzz around here that you'd be coming, Simon!
We heartily welcome you to our village.
{quest;goToBeeville;talkToQueen}
{optionCount;1}
{option0;queenGreeting2;Thank you, but why does everyone know me around here?}
]

[
{name;queenGreeting2}
Well I think you know the answer to that!
You're the hero! The one who defeated Emak those long years ago!
Wait, but then why are you here?
{optionCount;1}
{option0;queenEmakDiscussion2;Wait, where exactly am I?}
]



[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion2}
This is my village, a small outpost of bees forced out of our
city many years ago, back when Emak roamed this realm.
{next;queenEmakDiscussion3}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion3}
After you banished him from here, we thought we'd finally be
able to live in peace, and for the most part we have, but things
have been strange around here for a while.
{next;queenEmakDiscussion4}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion4}
And now that you're here...
Well, anyways, how exactly did you end up here?
{optionCount;1}
{option0;queenEmakDiscussion5;Emak was able to put together the Dimensional Sword}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion5}
Wait, is that what brought you here? I thought that was a myth!
So I assume you're trying to find a way back to your dimension?
{optionCount;1}
{option0;queenEmakDiscussion6;There's no point, he's unfightable now that he has that weapon}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion6}
Well, Simon, we may be able to help each other then.
I've heard stories of a great shield, capable of stopping
attacks from the Dimensional Sword.
{next;queenEmakDiscussion7}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion7}
Unfortunately it's being held by 3 of Emak's henchmen.
However, one of my drones found some activity in
a nearby cave, and we think that one of these pieces
may be inside, guarded by the evil Master Mole.
{next;queenEmakDiscussion8}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion8}
Could you help our town get rid of this looming threat?
We'll be glad to help in any way we can, but none of
 us can go in there alone.
{optionCount;1}
{option0;queenEmakDiscussion9;Sure, I'll see what I can do}
]

[
{name;queenEmakDiscussion9}
Really? We will forever be in your debt. To get there,
simply go out through the western road. You should be
able to see it right after leaving the palace.
Come talk to me after you defeat the mole!
{quest;killMole}
{setNext;postMole}

]

[
{name;postMole}
Oh, you're back already!
{next;goodMole;badMole;killMole;goToMole}

]

[
{name;badMole}
I wish we could help you with the mole, but we're
just not equipped for it.

Come back once you've been able to clear out that cave!
]

[
{name;goodMole}
Thank you so much Simon! I know this isn't it for you,
but your victory today has helped us out greatly.
{next;goodMole2}
]

[
{name;goodMole2}
I'll be sure to tell you if we learn any more about
other parts of the Dimensional Shield
{next;goodMole3}

[
{name;goodMole3}
THANK YOU FOR PLAYING PART 1 OF SIMON'S QUEST: BETWEEN WORLDS!

[
{name;welcom}
Welcome to the village, Simon!

[
{name;haveYouSeenDungeon}
Have you seen that cave? Man, it really must suck to be the poor
lad responsible for clearing that out...


Oh, hey Simon!
]


[
{name;gettingFlower}
I'm just out here getting some flowers. Still kinda unsettling to have
that cave there...
What could possibly be inside...
]

[
{name;happyToBeHere}
Honestly, that cave doesn't even bother me! I'm just happy to be
 here getting flowers!
]


[
{name;passageBlocked}
Sorry, Simon, the Queen requested that we block off this
part of the road due to the Emak threat
